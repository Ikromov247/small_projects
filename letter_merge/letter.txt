Thank you for your application to Writer's Block,
our Dark Tower program. We are unable to offer you a member position at this time.
We review all our applicants with the same process: screening, reference check, and interview.
Based on our findings, we do not find you to be a good match for our program.
I hope that you are able to find another avenue in
